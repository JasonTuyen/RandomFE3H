# RandomFE3H

A random team run generator for Fire Emblem Three Houses. Running this program will return you a team for your next playthough of Fire Emblem Three Houses. I created this program because I was getting bored of running "optimal" playthroughs of Three Houses and to practice my Python. 

Feel free to use any of the CSV files. This project is still ongoing, I need to add DLC content and create a GUI.

## Built With

* Python
* Tkinter for GUI

## Installation Instructions

To be added.
